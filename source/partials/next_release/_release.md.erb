<h4>Secrets Management</h4>

We have enhanced support for managing secrets in GoCD. GoCD now provides an ability to refer to secrets defined in an external Secret Manager. With this, apart from referring to secrets, users can manage permissions for these secrets and rotate them without any changes to GoCD configuration.

Support for Secrets Management is provided using plugins. We have introduced a new secrets extension using which plugin authors can write a plugin to support a Secret Manager of their choice. We have built a File based Secret Management plugin which is bundled along with GoCD.

Please refer to the [Secret Management Docs](https://docs.gocd.org/19.6.0/configuration/secrets_management.html) for more info.

<h4>Simpler HTTP authentication for agent-server communication</h4>

Historically, GoCD agent server communication required SSL/TLS mutual authentication using X509 certificates. GoCD version 19.6 disables mutual TLS by default. This will allow GoCD administrators to terminate agent-server communication at load balancers or reverse proxies.

To turn on the old behavior and enable mutual TLS, set the environment variable `GO_USE_TOKEN_AUTH` to `false`.


<h4>Running Dockerized GoCD Containers as Non Root</h4>

Starting from GoCD release `v19.6.0`, GoCD containers run as non-root user, by default. The Dockerized GoCD application will run as `go:root` (`uid:1000`, `gid:0`) user instead of running as `root:root` (`uid:0`, `gid:0`). For more information, checkout [Running Dockerized GoCD Containers as Non Root](https://www.gocd.org/2019/06/25/GoCD-non-root-containers/) blog post.

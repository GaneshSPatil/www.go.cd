<h4>Replacing X509 with simpler HTTP authentication for Agent-Server Communication - Beta feature</h4>

This is beta feature, agent-server commnication can be toggled to use token based auth instead of self-signed X509 certificates from server.
To enable token based auth, set the environment variable `GO_USE_TOKEN_AUTH` on the agent.

An agent would now be expected to send the following headers:

```
X-Agent-GUID: some-guid
Authorization: token
```
